	 	   <p>The tour starts at the entrance to the Schad Gallery of Biodiversity. </p>
	 	   
	 	   <p> Meet “Bull”, the Toronto Zoo’s oldest Southern White Rhino. He died at the age of 45 and,
	 	    since February 2009, has been standing tall at the entrance to the ROM’s Schad Gallery of Biodiversity. </p>
	 	   <h3>Why It’s Iconic </h3> 
	 	   <p> White rhinos are the second-largest land animal, measuring 11 feet long and weighing 4,500 pounds.
	 	     This species was brought back from the brink of extinction in the 1990s, but is in serious trouble again due to poaching
	 	     for its horns. </p>

	 	   <p>Walk to the right of the rhino and go straight past the bison and polar bear, 
	 	   walking underneath whales and sharks suspended from the ceiling, to the Coral Reef Tank. </p>
	 	   
	 	   <p> This Coral Reef represents a vital underwater ecosystem in the Indo-Pacific region. 
	 	   It demonstrates the balance between fish and coral, and how they both survive together from the
	 	    nutrients of a healthy ocean. </p>
	 	    
	 	   <h3> Cool Fact </h3> 
	 	   <p> Often mistaken as a plant, the coral is actually an ever-growing colony of invertebrates.</p>
